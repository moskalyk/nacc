# confide-compute
using PGP crypto to generate keys for nodes in a network, and using a user keypair, be able to encrypt inputs to a compute, so that only the user can read the ouput of the compute, allowable for multiple views into the data

statement: the intention is to be used for low level compute hardware to run ambiently as compute ozone, but not necessarily micro invasive brain computer interfaces
